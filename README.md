# Espresso Corner

Welcome to the repository for **Espresso Corner**, a simple yet functional website for a coffee shop. This project was created as a midterm assignment for my "[Internet Programming](https://vs.ieu.edu.tr/computer_programming/en/syllabus/type/read/id/MBP+102)" lecture. The main purpose of this project is to understand the integration of PHP with MySQL and frontend technologies.

## About the Project

Espresso Corner is a one-page design coffee shop website. The site is entirely custom-designed without the use of any templates, utilizing only HTML and CSS. The main features of the site include:

- **About Us**: Information about our coffee shop.
- **Who We Are**: Introduction to our team.
- **Menu**: A showcase of our most popular coffee selections.
- **Barista Training**: Details about our barista training program.
- **Reviews**: User-submitted reviews, stored in a MySQL database via PHP.
- **Contact**: A contact form using Formspree to send messages directly to my email.
- **Barista Registration Form**: A form for aspiring baristas to register, with data stored in a MySQL database via PHP.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to gain practical experience in connecting PHP with MySQL and frontend technologies. The project involves:

- Creating and handling forms with PHP.
- Storing and retrieving data from a MySQL database.
- Implementing user reviews and barista registration functionalities.

## Contact Form

The contact form on the site uses Formspree to handle submissions. When a user fills out the form, the data is sent directly to my email.

## Barista Registration and Reviews

Both the barista registration form and the reviews section utilize PHP to interact with the MySQL database. User inputs are captured and stored in the database, allowing for dynamic interaction and data storage.

## How to Work

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. **Set Up a Local Server**: Use a local server environment like WAMP, MAMP, or XAMPP.
3. **Move Files**: Place the project files in the `www` directory of your local server.
4. **Run the Server**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/coffee-shop-website`.
5. **Set Up the Database**:
    - Create a new database in your MySQL server.
    - Import the `DB.sql` file included in the repository into your newly created database. This will set up the necessary tables for the project.

## Conclusion

Espresso Corner is a demonstration of integrating backend and frontend technologies to create a functional and dynamic website. It serves as a practical example of handling form submissions, data storage, and user interactions using PHP and MySQL.
